## Features
This page is integrated in a Data Base and it's mobile responsive!

- 🅱️ **Bootstrap** — Bootstrap is an open-source web framework for developing interface and front-end components, specially for responsive pages.
- 🐘 **PHP** — PHP is a free interpreted language, used only for the development of applications present and acting on the server side, making the connection between the page and the database.
- 🗄️ **MySQL** — MySQL is a database management system, which uses the SQL language as an interface, that I chose for this project.
